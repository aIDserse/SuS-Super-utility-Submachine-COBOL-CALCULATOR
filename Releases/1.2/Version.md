VERSION 1.2
It has 14 funcions, works perfectly on the ide. 
It compiles, but the .exe file has problems: you can try it if you want... 
The code is in italian and English now!
This version has comma and signs, a big improvement from version 1.1
In a future update it will be another update saying "Do you want to do other calculations?" and if you say no it closes, if you say yes it restarts, and I will fix the issues compiling, but for now the project is complete.
You can use my code in your project ;)
