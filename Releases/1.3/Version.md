VERSION 1.3<br>
It has 14 funcions, works perfectly on the ide. <br>
Now it compiles! You can download the .exe in the EXECUTABLES foldes and they work out of the box!<br>
The code is in italian and English now<br>
This version has comma, signs and brackets!<br>
Now, when you do an operation, it says "Do you want to do another operation?" and if you say yes it returns to the beginning<br>
There will be only another update (2.0) that will make you wait half a sec. during the "Computing" process<br>
You can use my code in your project ;)
