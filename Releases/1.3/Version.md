VERSION 1.3
It has 14 funcions, works perfectly on the ide. 
Now it compiles! You can download the .exe in the EXECUTABLES foldes and they work out of the box!
The code is in italian and English now
This version has comma, signs and brackets!
Now, when you do an operation, it says "Do you want to do another operation?" and if you say yes it returns to the beginning
There will be only another update (2.0) that will make you wait half a sec. during the "Computing" process
You can use my code in your project ;)
