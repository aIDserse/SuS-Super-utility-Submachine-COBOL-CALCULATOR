# Final version - 2.0<br>
This is the definitive update of this project.<br>
It has 14 funcions, pre-compiled version is inclueded in the "EXECUTABLES" version<br>
When I'll have a Mac maybye I'll give a pre-compiled version for it too<br>
The code is in italian and English<br>
This version has comma, signs and brackets! <br>
When you do an operation, it says "Do you want to do another operation?" and if you say yes it returns to the beginning <br>
Now, when there is the computing process, it prints "computing..." making it in a more 50s way.<br>
You can use my code in your project and take inspiration from it ;)
