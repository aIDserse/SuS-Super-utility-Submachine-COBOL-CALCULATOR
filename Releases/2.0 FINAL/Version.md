Final version - 2.0
This is the definitive update of this project.
It has 14 funcions, pre-compiled version is inclueded in the "EXECUTABLES" version
When I'll have a Mac maybye I'll give a pre-compiled version for it too
he code is in italian and English
This version has comma, signs and brackets! 
When you do an operation, it says "Do you want to do another operation?" and if you say yes it returns to the beginning 
Now, when there is the computing process, it prints "computing..." making it in a more 50s way.
You can use my code in your project and take inspiration from it ;)
