VERSION 1.01
It has 14 funcions, works perfectly on the ide. It compiles, but the .exe file has problems: you can try it if you want... 
The code is only in Italian, but I'm gonna translate both versions (1.0 and 1.1) in Russian and English 
This version has comma in results, but you still can't insert it on the numbers to evalutate
You can use my code in your project ;)

NEXT CHANGES:
There will be a message saying: do you want to do other calculations? And if you say yes it takes you back (but this is sooo hard so it will comein not a so soon future)
Translations
Commas in evalutated numbers
