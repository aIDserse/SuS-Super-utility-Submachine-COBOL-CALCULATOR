VERSION 1.1<br>
It has 14 funcions, works perfectly on the ide. It compiles, but the .exe file has problems: you can try it if you want... <br>
The code is only in Italian, but I'm gonna translate it in English <br>
This version has comma in results, but you still can't insert it on the numbers to evalutate<br>
You can use my code in your project ;)<br>

NEXT CHANGES:<br>
There will be a message saying: do you want to do other calculations? And if you say yes it takes you back (but this is sooo hard so it will comein not a so soon future)<br>
Translations<br>
Commas in evalutated numbers<br>
