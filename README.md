It has 9 functions in version 1.0 and 14 since 1.1: the addition, subraction, Multiplication, division, squaring, square root, sin, tan and cos (in version 1.1 I added cubing, cube root, sin^-1, cos^-1 and tan^-1)<br>
I added some nice effects, that shows "computing....." when it does a calculation<br>
Version before 1.2 displays only rad, not degrees!.<br>
Since version 1.2 there is English Translation!<br>
With version 1.2 the calculator has commas and signs!<br>
With version 1.3 The calculator says "do you want do do other operations?" and if you say yes it takes you back to the choice of operations.<br>
Since version 2.0 (Final) During the calculations program, the calculator prints: computing..." in a distance of half a sec, making it in a more 50s way.<br>
A special thanks goes to Rick Smith ( https://stackoverflow.com/users/9170346/rick-smith?tab=profile ) who helped me a lot on writing the code.<br>
Attention! To run them you need the OpenCobolIDE dlls<br>
3rd October 2020 update! I re-written part of the english version with a better and more accurate translation:)<br>
If you want you can use the code for inspiration :)
