Open it in the OpenCobolIDE, it works 
It has 9 functions in version 1.0 and 14 in 1.1: the addition, subraction, 
multiplication, division, squaring, square root, sin, tan and cos (in version 1.1 I added cubing, cube root, sin^-1, cos^-1 and tan^-1)
I added some nice effects, that shows "computing....." when it does a calculation
Version before 1.2 displays only rad, not degrees!.
Since version 1.2 there is English Translation!
With version 1.2 the calculator has commas and signs!
There will be other updates in a not so soon future, but for now the project is complete
If you want you can use my code for inspiration :).
