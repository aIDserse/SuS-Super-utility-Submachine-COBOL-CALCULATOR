# SuS-super-utility-machine-
Open it in the OpenCobolIDE, it works 
It has 9 functions in version 1.0 and 14 in 1.1: the addition, subraction, 
multiplication, division, squaring, square root, sin, tan and cos (in version 1.1 I added cubing, cube root, sin^-1, cos^-1 and tan^-1)
The code is only in Italian now, but I'm already working at the translation
I added some nice effects, that shows "computing....." when it does a calculation
AT THE MOMENT THE FUNCIONT CALCS ARE DONE ONLY IN RAD, NO DEGREES!.
If you want you can use my code for inspiration :).
